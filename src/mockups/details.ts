            `NEW YORK and MIAMI, US – May 13, 2021. Signedeal, the pioneer in Negotiation Process Automation, today announced a partnership 
            with Celonis, the global leader in execution management, to help companies automate buying activities through the Automated Tactical 
            Buying (ATB) App. The ATB App turns an inherently manual process into 
            an automated auction that quickly and easily delivers a signed contract for a purchase in the absence of a strategic supplier.`,

            `The ATB App helps customers automate a time-consuming manual process and resolve executions barriers. Leveraging multilingual 
            text-to-speech technology, each supplier will automatically get contacted by phone, SMS, or e-mail to request their participation
            in the bidding process for selected items and to provide their best price, payment terms, and delivery date through an auction.`

            `“We are very enthusiastic about the value of this partnership for our customers,” said Esteban Berenstein, CEO of Signedeal. 
            “With the new Automated Tactical Buying (ATB) App customers will exponentially increase their ROI by removing all manual 
            activity within a very lengthy and time-consuming process of negotiating a Purchase Requisition item’s price. This process 
            typically requires many hours from category managers to negotiate one-by-one with different suppliers to determine the best price, 
            delivery date and payment terms. The new ATB App will streamline the price negotiation process by using it’s multilingual text-to-speech 
            negotiation technology, saving a lot of time and money all while providing a traceable and transparent mechanism to determine the best 
            possible supplier, eliminating subjectivity and personal preference.” `
